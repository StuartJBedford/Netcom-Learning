# Cloud Role and Requirements

**The Role**

- The role is cloud infrastructure engineer, some of the technical requirements for it would be understanding of network concepts, knowledge of systems admin with systems like Windows, Linux and Unix, and experience of virtualization with technologies such as WMware, Hyper-V or KVM and knowledge of security and best practices. The role also asks for experience working in data centres. which could also mean knowledge of databases like mySQL.

- some of the non technical skills that are required for the role would be, problem solving skills, communication skills, ability to both collaborate with people and work alone on your own initiative, potentially a driving license depending on the job, and the abililty to speak and write in english

**My thoughts on the role**

- I think the role of cloud engineer does require a lot of knowledge about a broad spectrum of things ranging from, obviously cloud engineering, but security, multiple operating systems, and vast knowledge of networking and how it works, I feel like if you were to take all the knowledge needed to be a cloud engineer, combine that with the knowledge of a full stack developer it would be like a one man it business

**What skills do I need to learn to achieve the role?**

- Networking
- Operating Systems
- IT Security
- Some coding
- Communication skills

**Do you think the role requires a College/University education?**

- I don't thing this role needs higher education, what I think this role requires is knowledge, experience and the ability to take on everything that is required for the job, an education may help with this, but is it require? I personally don't think so

**What other activities or tasks do you think that you should do to achieve the role**

- I think other activities that i should to to achieve this job would be maybe an introduction to systems security course, come life skill courses for helping with communication.
