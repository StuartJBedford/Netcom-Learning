#Manually

**Reason**

The reason I did it manually and not automate it was for the following reasons:

- Had no clue what I was doing, jumping from a list and dictionary, along with a for and while loops to head first into this barely understanding how to put it together to do the task
- Was only a small set of data so easy just to do quickly
- while finding an automating solution on google, found no point in using if I couldnt understand it
