**What are two AWS compute services, what do they do?**

- Amazon EC2
- Secure and resizable compute capacity (virtual servers) in the cloud
- launchable when needed without upfront commitments

- AWS Elastic Beanstalk
- easy to use service for deploying and scaling web applications and services

**What are two AWS Storage services, and what do they do?**

- Amazon S3
- Amazon S3 is object storage built to store and retrieve any amount of data from anywhere – web sites and mobile apps, corporate applications, and data from IoT sensors or devices.

- You can store any type of file in S3.

- S3 is designed to deliver 99.999999999% durability, and stores data for millions of applications used by market leaders in every industry.

- S3 provides comprehensive security and compliance capabilities that meet even the most stringent regulatory requirements.

- S3 gives customers flexibility in the way they manage data for cost optimization, access control, and compliance.

- Amazon snowball

- With AWS Snowball (Snowball), you can transfer hundreds of terabytes or petabytes of data between your on-premises data centers and Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3).

- Uses a secure storage device for physical transportation.

- AWS Snowball Client is software that is installed on a local computer and is used to identify, compress, encrypt, and transfer data.

- Uses 256-bit encryption (managed with the AWS KMS) and tamper-resistant enclosures with TPM.

- Snowball can import to S3 or export from S3.

- Import/export is when you send your own disks into AWS – this is being deprecated in favor of Snowball.

- Snowball must be ordered from and returned to the same region.
