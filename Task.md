In 6 months i'd like to be in work starting my career in IT, the company doesnt matter just something to get my foot in the door and some experience.

I'll get there by not only completing this course, but also finishing off my functional skills maths course at college, which would also open up the possibility of apprenticeships to me.

I'll learn about the cloud, and in my own time i'll look more into Linux operating system, docker containers for creating projects and take a more practical approach to learning python.

In 2 years i'd like to be a regular in development/ cloud computing services, no longer a junior but still learning and implementing the knowledge i've gained along the way.

**1. Where do I want to be in 5 years**

In 5 years I want to be in a position where im working my way to a senior level, earning more money and maybe even be at a large company.

**2. What would you like to learn?**

**- Within 6 months**

Within 6 months i'd like to learn about cloud engineering, gain more knowledge and be at a point that I can apply for jobs.

**- Within 2 years**

Within 2 years i'd like to learn front end development to a point that i can combine it and use it practically alongside the cloud.

**- Within 5 years**

Within 5 years i'd like to learn fullstack development, use that in conjunction with cloud computing to make my own apps, websites and whatever else that comes with it either as a side hobby or as part of my job

**3. One thing that you can do better is **\_**.**

One thing I could do better is concentration,work on ways to help remember information.

**4. What qualities do you admire in other people?**

I admire other people's confidence and people who are outgoing, I personally tend to keep thinking I need to know more when I could go out to find work, get help etc already, and I tend to shy away from truly challenging myself
